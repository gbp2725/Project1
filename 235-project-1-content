---
## Genre
    - Choose your own adventure
    - Fantasy
---
## Platform
    - Desktop only

---
## Story
- You are an adventurer ready to join a guild and start their journey! But with a journey comes choices and hardships. Do you have what it takes to live life as an adventurer?

---
## Esthetics
- The story will be shown through text with different music playing depending on the area the player is in. Sounds will be played for different actions throughout the story such as attacking, getting attacked, losing, etc.

---
## Gameplay
### Mechanics
- Since this game will be played for the story, the player will make their choices for the path they choose by clicking the choice that appears on the screen. There will also be a section for the previous choices and events that the player can click on to go to.

### Control
    - Mouse

### New user experience
-The controls for this game are straight forward once you know them so the first choice will tell the player how to play.

### Player learning
- What the player will need to learn to beat the game is what is considered a dangerous option within the choices and avoid picking them whenever possible. There will be multiple ways to beat the game so there is not a set path that is needed to follow.
